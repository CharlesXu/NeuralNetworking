TODO


Make different optional activation functions
besides the sigmoid function

implement a structure to take frequency data 
from a fast fourier transform (or similar) in
order to make the neural network structure 
smaller for ECG data.


Options for training epochs and stochastic
gradient descent.

implement linear algebra functions designed for
low level optimization on ARM archeticture, so 
that the network can feedforward efficiently on
small devices.

Other structural options for the neural network
to make learning faster/more efficient

In order to make response from ECG data more
efficient, implement ability to use network 
more like a recurrent neural network.

If it is possible, implement unsupervised learning on
a small scale in the code, so that a persons ECG readings
can develop and grow with them and improve their ability
to read the ECG data with time.
